# Zardoz-Armory-Rimworld

Zardoz speaks to you, his chosen ones. You have been raised up from brutality, to kill the brutals who multiply, and are legion. To this end, Zardoz your god gave you the gift of the gun. The gun is good. The penis is evil. The penis shoots seeds, and makes new life, and poisons the earth with a plague of men, as once it was. But the gun shoots death, and purifies the earth of the filth of brutals. Go forth and kill! 

From a movie by the way, for you uncultured types. 

Preface: This mod is made for me. Me alone. I'm just sharing it. So it's designed specifically for me, it may not be what you want but you're free to not download it. If you don't want the core changes you can edit the file called "ZA_CorePatches.xml". 

I've play tested it a little bit, I've confirmed everything is "right" in dev but you never know. So it's in beta. There may be balance changes. The bangberry throwable is way to dangerous for tribals.

[/list] 

[h1] Research Changes[/h1]
Gunsmithing was moved to be in between Smithing and Machining. Historically, being able to create better and better firearms drove the innovation in machining. This allows for 2 tiers of pre-Machining guns, the breach loader and revolver unlocked with smithing, and the repeating firearms unlocked with Gunsmithing(now before machining); bolt action, lever action, pumpshotgun, and the combat shotgun (trench shotgun with bayonet). 

[h1]New Craftable Guns[/h1]

    [*]Breech Loading rifle unlocked with Smithing. Using Rifle caliber ammunition. 
    [*]Lever Action Rifle unlocked with Gunsmithing. Pistol.
    [*]Combat Shotgun unlocked with Gunsmithing. Shotgun.
    [*]Battle Rifle unlocked with Gas Operation. Rifle.
    [*]General Purpose Machine Gun unlocked with Gas Operation. Rifle.
    [*]Mounted General Purpose Machine Gun unlocked with Gas Operation. Rifle.
    [*]Mounted Heavy Machine Gun unlocked with Precision Rifling. Heavy.
    [*]PDW unlocked with Precision Rifling. Pistol.

[/list] 

Small inconsistency between the art which is my bad (outline size). I need to do another pass on some of the earlier guns I did. 

[h1]To Come[/h1]
[list]
    [*]More unique guns (I'm open to suggestions)
    [*]More spacer tech guns
    [*]Compatibility patches with other weapon mods (maybe, this mod is designed to be the only one I need)

[h1]Credits [/h1] 
[list]
    [*]Janson's Weapontech served as a major inspiration, I've used that mod for maybe over 1800 hours. This mod was going to be a spiritual successor to it but then I realized Weapontech has a really favorable license so I was able to use some code from it to save time, namely the mounted weapon defs. I also copied his vanilla changes since to me they've become vanilla. So you can get earlier and cheaper armor because I've upped the armor pen on most things to deal with Yayo Combat 3.  I may make a patch for his mod someday to work with the ammo system.

    [*]Weapon textures were based off the fabulous models by TastyTony  [url=https://sketchfab.com/TastyTony/models] link [/url] and austincford  [url=https://sketchfab.com/austincford /models] link [/url] under this License  [url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/] link[/url]. They were edited and several of the weapons are actually based off both of their models combined together.
